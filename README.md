# Back2U – University Lost and Found Platform

# Features:
## 1 📝 Authority Intake & Cataloging (Staff):

This feature allows designated staff members to manage the official catalog of found items that are turned in at the desk. This serves as the system of record for all officially processed lost and found items.

### ✨ Key Functionality

Staff can **add**, **edit**, and **delete** records for found items.

* **Create Item:** Record a new item officially turned in.
* **Edit Item:** Update the details of an existing item record.
* **Delete Item:** Remove an item record (note: this is a hard delete; soft-delete functionality will be implemented later in #14).
